# justArt - my very first painting online gallery and selling platform.

- the fourth milestone project for my full stack web development schooling.

# UX

- the website is supposed to put together a vast collection of world known painting works for the art lovers, giving them the possibility to purchase the items when available.
- in the same time our gallery will offer young and talented artists the possibility to display and sell their paintings in our gallery, helping them to make themselves known around the world.
